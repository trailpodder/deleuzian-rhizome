# Deleuzian Rhizome Digital Artwork (3D Version)

This project is an interactive, generative digital artwork inspired by the **rhizome** concept of Gilles Deleuze and FÃ©lix Guattari. It visualizes a dynamic, non-hierarchical network of nodes connected in an evolving 3D space.

## Philosophical Inspiration

The **rhizome** metaphor opposes traditional tree-like hierarchies by emphasizing:

- Multiple entry and exit points
- No fixed center or origin
- Continuous growth and transformation
- Multiplicity and heterogeneity

This artwork embodies these ideas by representing nodes as spheres connected in a fluctuating 3D network, allowing exploration from any angle.

## Features

- **3D visualization** using [p5.js WEBGL](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/createCanvas) for immersive network exploration
- **Smooth organic movement** driven by Perlin noise for continuous "becoming" of node positions
- **Interactive node addition:** Click anywhere to add new nodes connected randomly to existing ones, creating multiple lines of flight

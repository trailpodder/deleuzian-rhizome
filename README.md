# Deleuzian Rhizome Digital Artwork

This project is a generative and interactive digital artwork inspired by the **rhizome** concept as developed by philosophers Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari. It visualizes a non-hierarchical, interconnected network of nodes and connections that evolves dynamically and encourages exploration through multiple entry points.

## Philosophical Inspiration

The **rhizome** is a metaphor contrasting traditional hierarchical trees of knowledge with an open-ended mesh of relationships. According to Deleuze and Guattari, rhizomes exhibit:

- Multiple entry and exit points
- No center or fixed origin
- Continuous growth and changing connections
- Multiplicity and heterogeneity instead of a single linear path

This artwork embodies these core ideas by creating a web of nodes that connect randomly and animate gently, while allowing users to add new nodes dynamically by clicking anywhere on the canvas—simulating new lines of flight and continuous becoming.

## Features

- **Generative network of nodes:** Nodes are placed randomly and connected non-hierarchically.
- **Dynamic movement:** Nodes slightly shift positions over time, reflecting constant change.
- **User interaction:** Click on the canvas to add new nodes connected to random existing nodes.
- **Visual aesthetics:** Soft glowing connections and subtle fading trails evoke an organic, fluid structure.
- Built with [p5.js](https://p5js.org), a creative coding JavaScript library.

## How to Run

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in a modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.).
3. Watch the rhizome form and evolve.
4. Click anywhere on the canvas to add new nodes and explore new pathways.

## File Structure

- `index.html` - HTML entry point loading p5.js and the main sketch.
- `sketch.js` - JavaScript code implementing generative rhizome logic and interaction.
- `style.css` (optional) - Styles for the webpage layout.
- `README.md` - This file.

## Extend & Experiment

Feel free to fork and modify this project to explore further:

- Add color coding or labels to nodes.
- Implement zoom and pan for navigation.
- Use 3D rendering libraries like Three.js for more complex spatial rhizomes.
- Integrate sound or other data as nodes’ attributes.
